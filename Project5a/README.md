## Issues
I liked Scala a fair amount - certainly more than Io and Prolog. But I have to say I see a lot less of a reason for Scala to exist than I do for Ruby or Prolog (sorry, Io...). It has some nice convenience features and all but in the end Java is the best Java.
My main issue was that I found the documentation on their site hard to navigate between the many different sections and two extant versions in use.
